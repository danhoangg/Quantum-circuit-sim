# Quantum Circuit simulator
A very primitive version a quantum circuit simulator, uses classes as circuits and qubits and allows the user to construct and play around with circuits within a programming setting, a lot less user friendly than a drag and drop circuit builder however works as a good point for someone to understand the maths behind quantum circuits
